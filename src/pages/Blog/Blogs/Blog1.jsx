        <p>Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions in your life since the next big part of your life depends on this one decision. You can of course switch careers or altogether choose to retire whenever you wish to but many when picking for the first time, think of their first career choice as their forever. This decision might seem daunting to you initially or you might be one of the lucky few who have a clear picture of what they want to be since childhood. Either way, after you have figured out a career field you are interested in and believe to have an aptitude for, comes a hurdle for many Indian kids - convincing your parents.</p>
        <p>In the Indian scenario, where family and values and family values are considered extremely important, parents/guardians have a say in their child’s career planning, sometimes so much that they end up making the decision on their child’s behalf. This can take numerous different forms. Maybe you thought of an unconventional career or one where the income is uncertain or not very high. Maybe you had a career other than the one which “runs in your family” in mind. Maybe you wanted to pursue a field on the other side of the spectrum as that of what your parents had planned. Maybe your career choice was labelled unreasonable. Or maybe you had a reasonable career all thought out and planned but it wasn’t as “safe” as what your parents had expected. In many such cases, parents usually tend to try and convince the child to go for the “safer” option they are suggesting and abandon the seemingly risky one the child wanted to follow. </p>
        <p>Parents/guardians with a high preference for stability are more inclined towards traditional careers which have been all charted out and are extremely established. In India, it usually boils down to one of these - Engineering, Medical, Law, Banking or Accountancy. Many children are pushed towards these only to ultimately see them drop out, switch careers or lead an unsatisfactory professional and working life.</p>
        <p>
            So what do you do if you’re in such a situation?
            Well, you could half-heartedly agree to your parents’ decision and put your dream career for safe-keeping to be daydreamed about while at work in this “safe” career path - you’re really not interested in or good at.
            Or you could be a rebel and not listen to your parents but listen to your heart and go ahead with following your dream career. But this might end up badly with you not being able to make it in the field, your relationship with your family getting strained or more dramatically with you being disowned the Bollywood style. 
            These might look like exaggerations and yes they are but they are so only to stress the fact that it is extremely important to try and come to a mutual decision with your parents/guardians about your career. And this is how you do it:    
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">1. Hear It From A Professional</h3>
        <p>Have a meet-up or a few sessions with a career counsellor who will help you see the real picture, identify the risks associated with your dream career and determine if the career is, in fact, suitable for you. A professional opinion is the best way to clear your doubts on this matter. For a more personal angle, you could talk to working professionals in the field and get an idea of what the working environment entails, their journey and some tips. </p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">2. Research and Planning</h3>
        <p>Start from the web - get details about your chosen career, everything you need to know before embarking on this journey. How, where and when to start,  top universities and exams to get into them, aptitude for the same, the working environment it offers, financial aspects of studies and jobs from entry-level to senior posts, how to climb up the ladder, experiences of people in the field, tips on how to avoid pitfalls the area might have, success stories and more importantly stories of failure and lessons to be learnt from these. Chart out a timeline with details on how you plan to step into this career. You might, of course, deviate from this but having plans is always good! This will help your parents realize your dedication and willingness to work for the cause. </p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">3. Discuss, Discuss And Discuss!</h3>
        <p>Talk to your parents about it. Tell them what you want to be and why you want to be. Be open about your plans, your fears, your expectations. Use your research and passion demonstration here. And after putting your point across, stop talking and start listening. Ask them why they want you to not follow this ABC career and go for XYZ instead. Listen to their experiences and even Sharmaji’s son’s success or failure story if you have to. The more you people talk about, the more there will be to discuss. After they’ve given all their inputs, ask and answer questions which will let you try and unravel the layers to reach the true motivations behind both your choices. This will help understand the problem clearly and find a solution which works for both.</p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">4. Finding The Intersection</h3>
        <p>Now that you have identified the motivations of both your parents’ choices and yours, try finding some common ground to start with and then move ahead from here - negotiating and trading off one thing over another. For instance, things will usually eventually boil down to your happiness in the long term and the difference will be in ways to achieve this. Try to find a way which satisfies such motivations.</p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">5. Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h3>
        <p>Your interest in your dream career might stem from somewhere and you might have started working early on this interest. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in animation, maybe you were involved in painting and drawing since childhood and pursued this interest. Show them your accomplishments in the field - it can be something as small as a certificate of appreciation in a painting contest or simply a beautiful painting you made, or your first digital art or something big like a national level prize. These will act as pieces of evidence to back your claim and your parents/guardians will probably realize that you’re good at it or that you are really passionate about it.</p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">6. Set A Mission</h3>
        <p>If your parents or guardians agree you can start with setting a small goal for the first step of your career. Pick a deadline and accomplish your goal within this time. These goals can be anything - getting into a university, starting a project, or even interning with a firm to see if you fit in. This will help your parents as well as you to see if you truly wish to go into that career.</p>

        <h3 className="text-main-blue ml-2">7. A Little Understanding Goes A Long Way</h3>
        <p>In the end, understanding and trust will help you make the decision. Understand that your parents want the best for you and will try to ensure this with whatever knowledge and understanding of the matter they have. Trust them and listen to their inputs. Following them or not comes later, the first step is listening and understanding their take on the matter.</p>

        <p>The above are simply suggestions and will not work for everybody given the widely varying dynamics and situations in every family. You can think along these lines and go with the ones you feel would work. Communication is key and if this can’t take place in a healthy way in a domestic environment, go for a counsellor. Personally tailored professional advice is the best way forward! In the end, you are free to be what you wish to but the simple act of doing this with your parents’ blessings will give you true happiness.</p>
